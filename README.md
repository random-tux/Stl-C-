# The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.

STL has four components

* Algorithms
* Containers
* Functions
* Iterators

# Algorithms
The header algorithm defines a collection of functions especially designed to be used on ranges of elements.They act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers.

* Algorithm
  * Sorting
  * Searching
  * Important STL Algorithms
  * Useful Array algorithms
  * Partition Operations
* Numeric
  * valarray class
