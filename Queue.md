# Queue STL Functions

Queues are a type of container adaptors which operate in a first in first out (FIFO) type of arrangement. Elements are inserted at the back (end) and are deleted from the front. The functions supported by queue are :

* empty() – Returns whether the queue is empty.
* size() – Returns the size of the queue.
* swap() – Exchange the contents of two queues but the queues must be of same type, although sizes may differ.
* emplace() – Insert a new element into the queue container, the new element is added to the end of the queue.
* front() – returns a reference to the first element of the queue. 
* back() – returns a reference to the last element of the queue.
* push(g) – adds the element ‘g’ at the end of the queue.
* pop() – deletes the first element of the queue.
